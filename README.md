## SMART CITY PROJECT

![Smart_city_image](smart-city-labos.jpeg)

## Description

  Our project is about the analysis for the improvement of the management of all kinds of anomalies declared in Paris.
We will proceed to these analyses by using a dataset that we extracted from the site :
[Open Data Paris Anomalies Dataset](https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/paris-anomalies/).

 All of our analyses on this dataset will be done from January 1, 2019 - April 2022.

To give more sense to our analyses, we will also use a dataset extracted from the site : [European Climate Assessement & Datasets](http://www.ecad.eu/)
, which gives us access to the weather data of the city of Paris.

We will proceed to the cleaning, and to the analyses of each dataset separately and independently of the other one to know the extent of the information which we can draw from it.

Finally, we will concatenate our two datasets to look for correlations between the weather data and the anomalies recorded in the city of Paris.

At the end of our study we will be able to bring recommendations to the city of Paris to improve the management and correction of anomalies according to several criteria.

Enjoy !
